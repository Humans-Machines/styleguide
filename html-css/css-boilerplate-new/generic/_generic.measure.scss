// The width of a line of text, in characters, is known as its measure.
// Choosing a reasonable measure is critical for the comfortable scanning
// of successive lines. The Elements Of Typographic Style considers any
// value between 45 and 75 reasonable.
//
// We use a Custom Property to define the max width. With this we can easily
// reset or overwrite it in some use cases – eg for bigger headlines
//
// 1. The value of 1ch is based on the width of the font’s 0 character.
// Importantly, this means changing the font-size changes the value of 1ch,
// thereby adapting the measure.
