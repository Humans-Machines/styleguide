# Guidelines for working with GIT

These guidelines are inspired by [https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) and [https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

## Projects

We use Gitlab to manage our own projects. It can be accessed via [https://git.humans.am](https://git.humans.am)

Repositories are grouped by clients. If you would like to create a new repository, make sure that there is a group for the client. New projects should always have the **Visibility Level** set to **Private**.

An example for a valid project path is **nomos/website**.
